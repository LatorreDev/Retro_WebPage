# My personal portoflio :briefcase:

This project has the purpose of show out my experience, featured projects, studies, articles and supply all my contact methods.

Made from scratch with React.js, Styled Components, Webpack and GH-Pages, it is a project on continuous development because I'm always implementing all the new technologies and techniques that I'm learning on it.
